                        Ever had the problem where you just didnt know if your milk was good enough to drink? 
                        Well we got the solution for you, this survey will help you determine if your milk is still drinkable.

                        The result can contain High - Medium - Low Grades. 
                        When your milk is low grade it means you shouldnt drink it anymore and throw it away, When your milk is medium it
                        will still be drinkable but not as good as high grade milk.
